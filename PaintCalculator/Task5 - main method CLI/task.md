  <table>
  <caption>I/O Test Cases</caption>
  <tr>
  <th>#1</th>
  <td>
  Enter length, width and height:
  <i>12.0 15.0 10.0</i><br>
  Buy 3 gallons of paint.
  </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <th>#2</th>
  <td>
  Enter length, width and height:
  <i>7.5 11.5 8.25</i><br>
  Buy 2 gallons of paint.
  </td>
  </tr>
  </table>

- Update the `main` method to prompt for the room length, width, and height. The 
  `main` method should call the `gallonsPaint` method and print the result as shown in the test cases.
- Run the program and confirm the expected result.
- Check your solution.
