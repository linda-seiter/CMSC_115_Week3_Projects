You will implement methods in the `PaintCalculator` class to compute the gallons
of paint needed to cover the ceiling and walls of a rectangular room. 
The room dimensions are given as length, width, and height.

The structure chart below shows the call graph of the methods you will implement.

You will use a bottom up approach, i.e. start by implementing
the methods on the bottom of the call graph.

- Task 1: `ceilingArea` method
- Task 2: `wallArea` method
- Task 3: `roomArea` method
- Task 4: `gallonsPaint` method
- Task 5: `main` method I/O
